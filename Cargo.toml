description = """
A library to generate, identify and handle prime numbers and related
properties.  This library includes slow enumeration of primes up to a
bound, slow factorisation of arbitrary numbers, fast primality tests
and state-of-the-art estimation of upper and lower bounds for π(n)
(the number of primes below n) and p_k (the k-th prime).
